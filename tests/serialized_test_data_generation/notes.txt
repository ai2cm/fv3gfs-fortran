Here's what we tried to get test_case1 from fortran working.

1. Compiled fv3gfs-fortran from root, with added compile flag SW_DYNAMICS.
    Then tried running c12_6ranks_baroclinic.yml with npz=1 and test_case = 1. 
    - did not work. Got errors saying that test_case1 was not defined. 
    - Lucas suggested makefile doesn't always apply the SW_DYNAMICS flag as the reason.

2. Went into test_cases.F90 and forced it to run only SW_DYNAMICS conditional compilation.
    Commented out all #if ... SW_DYNAMICS and everything in #elseif/#else statements. 
    Compiled - this part worked. 
    Ran the model with the c12_6ranks_baroclinic namelist.
    It ran (no more test_case not defined) errors, but crashed. 
    Probably incompatible namelist options, but we don't know which ones work
    - tried changing ntiles to 1, but it wouldn't run.

3. At this point, we only want to look at the initial condition, so we tried running in 
    tests>serialized_test_data_generation. 
    For this to run, need to source pre_run.sh to export the right environment variables.
    make build_model is successful.
    Made modifications to make_all_datasets.sh so it doesn't upload data, just envs=("init"). 
    This creates files, which is good. 
    - We compared to jupyter notebook, pattern was correct, but with some differences in
        magnitude. 
    
    Next: try adding ser statements to print out more data and figure out where the 
    differences are coming from.
