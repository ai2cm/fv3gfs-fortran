Description: FV3Config
        =========
        
        
        FV3Config is used to configure and manipulate run directories for FV3GFS.
        
        * Free software: BSD license
        
        Basic usage
        -----------
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from fv3config import write_run_directory
        
            with open("config.yml", 'r') as f:
                config = yaml.safe_load(f)
            write_run_directory(config, './rundir')
        
        :code:`config` is a configuration dictionary which contains namelists, input data specifications,
        and other options. It can be edited just like any dictionary.
        
        For more in-depth usage, please refer to the documentation. This can be generated with :code:`make docs`.

        latest
        ------
        
        Breaking changes:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        - enable_restart function now requires an initial_conditions argument. It also sets
          force_date_from_namelist to False.
        
        Major changes:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - a new public function `fv3gfs.get_bytes_asset_dict`
        - a new command line interface `write_run_directory`
        - removed integration tests for run_docker and run_native which actually executed the model
        - all tests are now offline, using a mocked in-memory gcsfs to represent remote communication.
        - add a Dockerfile to produce a lightweight image with fv3config installed
        
        - Add new public functions `fv3config.get_nudging_assets` and `fv3config.update_config_for_nudging`.
        - Add CLI entry points for enable_restart and update_config_for_nudging.
        
        Minor changes:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        - updated create_rundir example to accept external arguments
        - refactor get_current_date function to not require the path to the INPUT directory.
        
        v0.4.0 (2020-07-09)
        -------------------
        
        Major changes:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        - the old "default" data options are removed
        - orographic_forcing is now a required configuration key
        - get_default_config() is removed, with a placeholder which says it was removed
        - ensure_data_is_downloaded is removed, with a placeholder which says it was removed
        
        v0.3.2 (2020-04-16)
        -------------------
        
        Major changes:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        - filesystem operations now manually backoff with a 1-minute max time on RuntimeError (which gcsfs often raises when it shouldn't) and gcsfs.utils.HttpError
        - `put_directory` now makes use of a thread pool to copy items in parallel.
        
        Minor changes:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        - `run_docker` now works when supplying an outdir on google cloud storage
        - `put_directory` is now marked as package-private instead of module-private
        
        
        v0.3.1 (2020-04-08)
        -------------------
        
        Major changes:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        - Add get_timestep and config_from_yaml functions
        
        Minor changes:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        - Allow config_to_yaml to write to remote locations
        - Control whether outputs are logged to console or not in `run_kubernetes`, `run_native`, and `run_docker`.
        
        Breaking changes
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        - Print stderr and stdout to the console by default when using fv3run. Use the
          `--capture-output` command-line flag to enable the previous behavior.
        
        
        v0.3.0 (2020-04-03)
        -------------------
        
        Major changes:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        - Added `--kubernetes` command-line flag to output a kubernetes config yaml to stdout
        
        Minor changes:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        - Added the flag ``--mca btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism none to mpirun in fv3run`` to mpirun in fv3run
        - Add ReadTheDocs configuration file
        - Do not require output dir and fv3config to be remote in ``run_kubernetes``
        - Fix bug when submitting k8s jobs with images that have an "_" in them
        
        Breaking changes
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        - Refactored run_kubernetes and run_docker to call run_native via a new API serializing
          their args/kwargs as json strings. The
          fv3config version in a docker image must be greater than or equal inside a
          container to outside, or a silent error will occur.
        - When output location is set to a local path, the job now runs in that output location instead of in a temporary directory which then gets copied. This is done both to reduce copying time for large jobs, and to improve visibility of model behavior while running.
